Data and code for an experiment testing a resource quality gradient on Mid37 and Standard clones of Daphnia dentifera when infected with either Metschnikowia bicuspidata fungus or Pasteuria ramosa bacteria.

### Abstract
Resource quality can have conflicting effects on host–parasite interactions; for example, higher resource quality might increase host investment in immune function, or conversely, might permit greater parasite reproduction. Thus, anticipating the impact of changing resource quality on host–parasite interactions is challenging, especially because we often lack a mechanistic understanding of how resource quality influences host physiology and fitness to alter infection outcomes. We investigated whether there are generalizations in how resource quality affects multiple host genotypes’ interactions with different parasites. We used the Daphnia freshwater zooplankton model system to experimentally investigate how a resource quality gradient from high-quality green algae to poor-quality cyanobacteria diets influences host fitness, physiology, and infection by two parasites: a bacterium, Pasteuria ramosa, and a fungus, Metschnikowia bicuspidata. We ran a separate experiment for each parasite using a factorial design with four diet treatments, two Daphnia dentifera host genotypes, and parasite-inoculated and uninoculated treatments (16 treatments per experiment). As expected, poor quality diets reduced host fecundity, growth, feeding and metabolic rates, and survival. Diet strongly influenced parasite encounter, and host genotypes changed their feeding behavior and life history strategies in response to the two parasites. However, the specific responses often differed between the two host genotypes and the two parasites. Overall, we show that resource quality differentially impacts the exposure, infection, and proliferation processes for different parasites and host genotypes, which highlights the need to use multi-genotype and multi-parasite studies to better understand these complex interactions.
