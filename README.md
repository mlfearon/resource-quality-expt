# resource-quality-expt
Data and code for an experiment testing a resource quality gradient on Mid37 and Standard clones of Daphnia dentifera when infected with either Metschnikowia bicuspidata fungus or Pasteuria ramosa bacteria.

###Abstract
Resource quality can have conflicting effects on the outcome of interactions between hosts and their parasites. High-quality resources may alter a host’s exposure to parasites, increase host investment in immune function to resist infection, or allow the parasite to exploit the resources to produce more infectious propagules. However, we often lack a mechanistic understanding of how changes in resource quality will impact host physiology and infection dynamics, and whether there are any generalizations in how resource quality affects host interactions with different parasites. I use the freshwater zooplankton, Daphnia, model system to experimentally investigate how resource quality influences host fitness, physiology, and infection by two different parasites. Furthermore, I will assess whether the effect of the resource quality gradient on host–parasite interactions are concordant between the two parasites. I found that the resource quality gradient consistently altered host traits, but had different effects on parasite exposure and infection.
